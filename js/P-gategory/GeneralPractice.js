    excellent sound characteristics due to the perfectly tuned mass proportion of chest piece to Vibrason diaphragm. Reversible, suitable for all frequency ranges
    retaining ring of diaphragm made of light metal with SOFTFEEL coating for more comfort on the skin. Fine thread for long shelf life and easy exchanging of the Vibrason diaphragm – no use of plastic due to increased wear.
    moveable SOFTBUDS ear tips made of soft silicone in sound insulating design for most intensive hearing: pleasant wearing comfort because soft on the outside, thereby perfect adaptation to the auditory canal to prevent any disturbing background noises and for optimum sound transmission. The inside plastic body prevents the inadvertend closing of the acoustic noise during head movements. Easy to replace, incl. each 1 pair of SOFTBUDS in size S/M/L

        The hands-free interface and SpO2 measurement option make the BP-200 plus a comprehensive device for diagnostic test centres. The BP-200 plus is also ideal in research environments because raw data can be saved on an SD card.
        The BP-200 plus excels where other BP monitors fail, by using SCHILLER K-Sound Analysis (SKA). SKA was developed as a result of SCHILLER’s pioneering work in 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. With SCHILLER K-Sound Analysis, Korotkoff sounds are distinguished from artefact noise so that blood pressures are measured accurately with greatly reduced false measurements.

Spengler excellence within everyone’s reach!New cuff with wide spectrum
        The new cuff covers both M and L sizes with a width of 22 to 42 cm. It can thus be adapted to the morphology of many patients. It is easy for practitioners to use on a daily basis, and an essential aide for family use in self-diagnosis. A size S cuff is also available as an option.
        WHO indicator for immediate diagnosis
        Thanks to the WHO tricolour indicator, the result obtained can be read in real time. No more questions needed. The diagnosis is reliable and precise, and can be shared immediately with your practitioner or your family and friends. The large backlit display is pleasant to read.
        Accuracy which can be shared
        Family use of the Tensonic arm is possible thanks to its double memory of 60 time-stamped measurements. This makes it easy to switch from Patient 1 to Patient 2 mode without losing any of the previous self-diagnostics.
