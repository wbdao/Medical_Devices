            desc: `The topic of e-mobility for cars has been hot topic for a while. Technical developments continue to build up, influencing related technologies and even share prices. We have taken that as a signal that itâ€™s high time to look into the suitability of new driveline technology for special vehicle builds and emergency service vehicles. With our E-Concept, we thoroughly address the issue of whether electric power is a suitable alternative for larger response vehicles with weights of up to five tonnes. This pilot project aims to move ideas forward and set processes in motion. We understand the theory, and we are now giving practical impetus to e-mobility for the emergency services.
