        Advanced Heart Failure Management
        The HeartWare™ HVAD™ System is a full-support, durable ventricular assist device (VAD) that is FDA-approved for a less-invasive thoracotomy approach, destination therapy, and bridge to transplant.
        UNIQUELY DESIGNED
        The HVAD Pump is engineered for reliability and durability.
        The pump's passive maglev with hydrodynamic bearings means there's no need for electronic sensors or mechanical bearings. This results in a less complex system that eliminates friction, heat, and component wear.2
        Dual motor stators enhance efficiency and provide redundancy to rotate the impeller.2
        A patented, wide-blade impeller features three blood flow paths. These are designed to enhance blood flow and reduce blood trauma while reducing the time blood travels through the device.2`,

Both failing ventricles and all four heart valves are replaced by it. The native heart complication is eliminated by the device without ventricle dysfunction/failure, diseased heart valves and arrhythmias or requirement of pacemaker. Up to 9.5 L/min instant, secure blood flow is provided through both ventricles. The device instantly restores normal Cardiac Index and Central Venous Pressure and conquers high Pulmonary Arterial Pressure. Usual hemodynamics and organ perfusion is restored. SynCardia’s Total Artificial Heart is straight away available at centers certified by SynCardia. Expensive, immunosuppressant medication is not required by the device and hence eliminates subsequent complications.`,

        Carmat aims to meet a major public health challenge related to cardiovascular diseases, namely heart failure, the leading cause of death in the world. More specifically, Carmat aims to provide a lasting solution to the treatment of terminal heart failure, a disease for which there are very few effective options today, the main one being heart transplants.
        HEART FAILURE
        Heart Failure occurs when the heart can no longer carry out its essential function as a “blood pump” and provide a sufficient cardiac output to satisfy the metabolic needs of the organism. It primarily affects the left chamber of the heart, then the right chamber leading to biventricular heart failure. At this stage, vital organs such as the brain, liver and kidneys do not receive enough nutrients and oxygen to function properly. The main symptoms of the disease include fatigue, shortness of breath (even at rest), and fluid retention.`,
