        STABILITY FOR LIFE
        Despite the excellent longevity of total knee arthroplasty,
        many patients continue to experience functional deficits after surgery.
        
        Patient expectations are not as well fulfilled by TKA as by total hip replacement with fewer knee patients achieving a “forgotten joint” replacement. Studies show that around 20% of TKA patients are not satisfied[1, 2, 3]. Excessive A/P motion may result in anterior knee pain and continued swelling. In many P/S designs, the stabilising mechanism only engages after 70-80° of flexion leaving the knee vulnerable to A/P instability during the most commonly encountered functional activities`,

        It is arthroscopically attached to fill the void resulting from damaged and lost meniscal tissue and makes use of the body’s own healing ability.</br></br>
        The porous implant matrix initially serves as a guide for the migration of the body’s own cells and is completely absorbed afterwards. More than 16 years of clinical experience has proven that this is an established procedure for meniscus treatment. A defect filled with new tissue potentially reduces the risk of arthrosis and produces outstanding clinical results, thus improving patients’ quality of life and physical resilience.`,

Currently, meniscal injuries are usually treated by partial meniscectomy: surgical removal of the damaged tissue using a minimally invasive keyhole procedure. Unfortunately, meniscectomy can lead to subsequent deterioration of the articular knee cartilage, eventually resulting in the painful condition, osteoarthritis.</br></br>
        FibroFix™ Meniscus is a product which replaces the tissue removed in a meniscectomy procedure. It is cut to size in theatre by the surgeon and introduced into the knee through the same keyhole incision used to perform the meniscectomy. Once fixed in place, FibroFix™ Meniscus has the properties required to assume the role of the tissue removed in the meniscetomy procedure, whilst also allowing new tissue to grow into the body of the implant, enabling a longer term regenerative repair.`,
